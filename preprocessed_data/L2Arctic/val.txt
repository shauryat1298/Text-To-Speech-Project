arctic_b0479|ASI|Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
arctic_a0094|NCC|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
arctic_a0400|TLV|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0234|YBAA|And watch out for wet feet was his parting advice
arctic_a0456|BWC|But it won't continue she said with easy confidence
arctic_a0473|HQTV|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0416|LXC|I arose obediently and went down the beach
arctic_a0101|NCC|You you would not keep the truth from me
arctic_b0136|YKWK|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation
arctic_a0400|MBMPS|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0450|ZHAA|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0226|RRBI|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0459|BWC|There's too much of the schoolboy in me
arctic_b0177|TNI|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0387|ZHAA|It is merely the simple superlative
arctic_b0177|YBAA|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0307|MBMPS|We got few vegetables and fruits and became fish eaters
arctic_a0450|TNI|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0450|RRBI|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0502|YDCK|And as we hurried up town Joe Goose explained
arctic_a0181|ERMS|So cheer up and give us your paw
arctic_b0292|THV|The Fire Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders
arctic_a0400|ERMS|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0215|SVBI|They die out of spite
arctic_a0408|ASI|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test
arctic_a0580|ZHAA|This is my fifth voyage
arctic_b0005|ERMS|His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's
arctic_b0499|YDCK|I said and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about
arctic_b0475|HJK|Not a wheel moved in his empire
arctic_a0473|YBAA|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0515|THV|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out
arctic_a0543|BWC|I had been born with no organic chemical predisposition toward alcohol
arctic_b0267|TNI|The boy threw back his head with pride
arctic_b0444|ABA|He didn't know what went on in the minds of his superiors
arctic_b0139|RRBI|Together they ate the rabbit
arctic_b0161|YKWK|In a flash he was on his feet facing him
arctic_a0450|PNV|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0477|MBMPS|Wada Louis and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed
arctic_b0177|LXC|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0111|MBMPS|The journey was continued at dawn
arctic_a0028|THV|Robbery bribery fraud 
arctic_b0226|HJK|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0055|SVBI|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her before
arctic_a0013|LXC|He was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
arctic_b0173|NJS|To these he gave castor oil
arctic_a0107|PNV|If you only could know how I thank you
arctic_b0226|EBVS|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0436|NJS|But Martin smiled a superior smile
arctic_a0053|NCC|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
arctic_b0077|HJK|It is the nearest refuge
arctic_b0130|ERMS|She saw the answer in his face
arctic_b0374|SVBI|To say the least Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist
arctic_b0226|ASI|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0329|TLV|I'd sooner have my chips back
arctic_b0091|YBAA|For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking
arctic_b0361|NJS|There are the canals of China and the Yangtse River
arctic_b0177|ABA|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0528|LXC|Captain Doane's orders were swiftly obeyed
arctic_b0291|TLV|The awe of man rushed over him again
arctic_b0177|THV|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0468|THV|It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio
arctic_a0400|TXHC|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0226|MBMPS|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0419|TXHC|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian
arctic_a0473|BWC|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0206|EBVS|Horses and rifles had been her toys camp and trail her nursery
arctic_a0450|MBMPS|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0106|YKWK|For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face
arctic_a0190|SVBI|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent
arctic_a0560|PNV|His mouth opened words shaped vainly on his lips
arctic_b0483|YDCK|The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
arctic_b0177|YKWK|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0024|HQTV|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
arctic_b0159|YBAA|His teeth shut with a last click
arctic_a0408|PNV|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test
arctic_a0400|EBVS|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0012|ASI|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him
arctic_b0123|EBVS|Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men
arctic_a0341|HJK|Why doggone you all shake again
arctic_a0292|TLV|Here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
arctic_a0296|NJS|Bassett was a fastidious man
arctic_b0177|NJS|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0450|TNI|To my dearest and always appreciated friend I submit myself
arctic_b0177|NCC|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0256|ABA|Outwardly he maintained a calm and smiling aspect
arctic_b0462|TXHC|One guess will do Ernest retorted
arctic_a0473|ERMS|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0143|YBAA|It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it
arctic_a0204|YBAA|The wolf dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him
arctic_a0450|LXC|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0046|YDCK|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him
arctic_a0397|TXHC|Call me that again he murmured ecstatically
arctic_b0177|HQTV|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0357|ASI|The Law of Club and Fang
arctic_a0544|ZHAA|He may anticipate the day of his death
arctic_b0482|ERMS|Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript
arctic_a0567|LXC|Now Irvine was a man of impulse a poet
arctic_b0273|SKA|Then it was that a strange thing happened
arctic_a0348|YDCK|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty
arctic_b0466|BWC|It is dog eat dog and you ate them up
arctic_b0097|SKA|Besides that noise makes me deaf
arctic_a0450|YKWK|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0248|ZHAA|I had been sad too long already
arctic_b0283|ZHAA|But we were without this momentum
arctic_b0422|ASI|This was when the explosion occurred
arctic_a0117|SKA|She added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
arctic_a0400|ZHAA|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0055|LXC|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her before
arctic_b0182|ASI|I was in New York when the crash came
arctic_a0473|THV|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0473|ABA|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0069|HKK|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre
arctic_a0400|YDCK|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0178|ABA|Also I want information
arctic_b0105|HJK|I know that you are in charge there and Jeanne knows
arctic_b0467|THV|Let us run them for ourselves
arctic_b0120|SVBI|There's the hitch replied Thorpe rolling a cigarette
arctic_b0088|ASI|Until I die he exclaimed
arctic_a0400|RRBI|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0450|NCC|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0226|SVBI|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0412|MBMPS|Ah it was sweet in my ears
arctic_b0081|NCC|You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock
arctic_b0325|HJK|It was a gigantic inadequacy
arctic_a0262|MBMPS|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha
arctic_b0198|PNV|I use great trouble advisedly
arctic_b0232|YKWK|It was a superb picture
arctic_a0344|HJK|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality
arctic_b0399|RRBI|You were looking squeamish this afternoon he began
arctic_a0279|NCC|She said with chattering teeth
arctic_b0395|SVBI|I was beneath the water suffocating and drowning
arctic_b0226|NJS|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0342|NCC|Seventeen no eighteen days ago
arctic_a0164|ERMS|He came first a year ago and revealed himself to Jeanne
arctic_b0428|ZHAA|The history of our westward faring race is written in it
arctic_b0226|YKWK|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0177|TXHC|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0528|NJS|Captain Doane's orders were swiftly obeyed
arctic_a0209|SVBI|It was not a large lake and almost round
arctic_a0416|HQTV|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
arctic_b0164|ERMS|They laughed like two happy children
arctic_b0079|ASI|The truth of it set Jeanne quivering
arctic_b0036|YBAA|He wondered too where Roscoe was
arctic_b0226|YDCK|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0417|SKA|It is also an insidious deceitful sun
arctic_a0539|NJS|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that
arctic_b0177|ERMS|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0450|HJK|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0213|RRBI|Between him and the beach was the cane grass fence of the compound
arctic_a0175|HKK|Down there the earth was already swelling with life
arctic_b0045|BWC|Philip didn't pursue the subject
arctic_b0082|LXC|He bit his tongue and cursed himself at this fresh break
arctic_b0145|TLV|Besides had he not whipped the big owl in the forest
arctic_a0040|HQTV|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
arctic_a0400|BWC|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0282|EBVS|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured
arctic_b0032|HKK|He caught himself with a jerk
arctic_b0159|YKWK|His teeth shut with a last click
arctic_a0435|SVBI|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct
arctic_b0472|YBAA|Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import
arctic_b0158|TLV|She obeyed shrinking back with the baby in her arms
arctic_b0226|TLV|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0226|ZHAA|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0400|NJS|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0177|SKA|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0142|RRBI|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now
arctic_b0476|NJS|The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution
arctic_b0286|ZHAA|The time was considered auspicious
arctic_a0418|THV|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer
arctic_b0454|PNV|Eighteen he added
arctic_b0114|ZHAA|He moved his position and the illusion was gone
arctic_a0154|EBVS|He was smooth shaven and his hair and eyes were black
arctic_a0231|EBVS|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia
arctic_a0461|MBMPS|Ah we were very close together in that moment
arctic_b0268|MBMPS|Saxon nodded and the boy frowned
arctic_b0342|ERMS|Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up
arctic_a0473|PNV|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0177|BWC|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0533|HJK|Dunham can your boy go along with Jesse
arctic_a0389|EBVS|Mab she said
arctic_b0183|LXC|No I did not fall among thieves
arctic_a0140|TNI|Accept a father's blessing and with it this
arctic_a0473|NJS|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0444|HJK|He did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors
arctic_a0473|TNI|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0451|LXC|You used to joy ride like the very devil
arctic_b0233|MBMPS|So she said the irate skipper dashed on
arctic_b0177|TLV|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0400|YBAA|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0450|HKK|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0467|TLV|And so early in the voyage too
arctic_b0033|ERMS|How does your wager look now
arctic_a0473|ZHAA|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0362|SKA|Nope not the slightest idea
arctic_a0426|ERMS|They do not know the length of time of incubation
arctic_b0096|NJS|Within himself he called it no longer his own
arctic_a0482|HQTV|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out
arctic_b0146|PNV|After all it was simply a mistake in judgment
arctic_a0038|HQTV|We'll have to watch our chances
arctic_a0443|TXHC|He was worth nothing to the world
arctic_a0473|HKK|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0016|YDCK|He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it
arctic_b0305|THV|It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp
arctic_b0295|HKK|All right Sir replied Jock with great regret
arctic_a0473|ASI|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0160|MBMPS|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt
arctic_a0410|THV|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
arctic_a0214|HQTV|Besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
arctic_a0450|THV|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0263|RRBI|Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another
arctic_b0177|ZHAA|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0030|PNV|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips
arctic_a0450|YDCK|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0122|RRBI|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this
arctic_b0272|YBAA|These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter
arctic_b0536|ASI|Typhoid did I tell you
arctic_b0064|TXHC|I'm going down there with you and I'm going to fight
arctic_a0356|YDCK|You don't catch me at any such foolishness
arctic_b0440|ERMS|There were stir and bustle new faces and fresh facts
arctic_b0455|NJS|His reward should have been peace and repose
arctic_b0090|YDCK|The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed
arctic_b0449|YDCK|Also she wouldn't walk
arctic_a0291|TXHC|The weeks had gone by and no overt acts had been attempted
arctic_b0351|YKWK|Matthewson who's this bookkeeper Rogers
arctic_a0152|TXHC|Philip thrust himself against it and entered
arctic_a0400|PNV|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0254|NCC|At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders
arctic_a0020|HQTV|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
arctic_a0450|BWC|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0536|SKA|He would destroy all things that are fixed
arctic_b0135|ZHAA|In it was the joy of life
arctic_b0103|TNI|He lifted his eyes and a strange cry burst from his lips
arctic_b0096|TLV|Within himself he called it no longer his own
arctic_a0114|TXHC|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip
arctic_a0290|TNI|One by one the boys were captured
arctic_a0281|HJK|I do not blame you for anything remember that
arctic_a0138|YKWK|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne
arctic_b0067|SVBI|Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight
arctic_a0280|NJS|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes
arctic_b0226|TXHC|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0226|YBAA|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0353|YKWK|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out
arctic_b0216|YDCK|I wish you were more adaptable Joan retorted
arctic_b0191|PNV|He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons
arctic_a0567|HJK|Now Irvine was a man of impulse a poet
arctic_b0451|MBMPS|You used to joy ride like the very devil
arctic_b0351|ASI|Matthewson who's this bookkeeper Rogers
arctic_b0177|YDCK|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0008|NCC|Gad your letter came just in time
arctic_b0046|BWC|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him
arctic_b0538|RRBI|At the best they were necessary accessories
arctic_b0177|HJK|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0127|MBMPS|It was a temptation but he resisted it
arctic_b0511|TNI|Do you value your hide
arctic_b0043|YKWK|It won't be for sale
arctic_b0177|HKK|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_b0363|NCC|She was built primarily to sail
arctic_a0400|HJK|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0513|HJK|He plodded on for half an hour when the hallucination arose again
arctic_b0131|ABA|Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp and kill you
arctic_a0377|MBMPS|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place
arctic_a0524|HQTV|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states
arctic_b0201|YBAA|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe
arctic_b0153|HJK|He was a pariah a wanderer without a friend or a home
arctic_b0490|ZHAA|What an excited whispering and conferring took place
arctic_b0512|YDCK|You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook
arctic_a0482|TLV|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out
arctic_b0306|PNV|Cameron looked at his hands with their long sinewy fingers
arctic_a0539|PNV|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that
arctic_b0456|HQTV|He was an amphibian and a mountaineer
arctic_a0470|BWC|He spat it out like so much venom
arctic_a0321|SKA|The log on which Lop Ear was lying got adrift
arctic_a0373|EBVS|Points of view new ideas life
arctic_a0323|TXHC|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat
arctic_a0451|PNV|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot left hand
arctic_a0450|HQTV|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0551|ASI|All an appearance can know is mirage
arctic_a0421|HQTV|By golly the boy wins
arctic_a0295|ERMS|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
arctic_a0429|NCC|Quick was the disappointment in his face yet smiling was the acquiescence
arctic_a0089|THV|The night glow was treacherous to shoot by
arctic_a0084|PNV|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open
arctic_b0226|LXC|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0323|TLV|Crickets began to chirp and more geese and ducks flew overhead
arctic_a0002|NCC|Not at this particular case Tom apologized Whittemore
arctic_a0450|EBVS|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0178|SVBI|Also I want information
arctic_a0308|ABA|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it
arctic_b0069|RRBI|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre
arctic_b0448|YDCK|Sandel would never become a world champion
arctic_b0183|TXHC|No I did not fall among thieves
arctic_b0111|YBAA|The journey was continued at dawn
arctic_b0356|ASI|He loved to play Chinese lottery
arctic_a0324|EBVS|It was not Red Eye's way to forego revenge so easily
arctic_a0209|TNI|It was not a large lake and almost round
arctic_a0450|SVBI|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_a0473|EBVS|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0185|EBVS|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind
arctic_a0320|YKWK|With my strength I slammed it full into Red Eye's face
arctic_a0473|HJK|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0226|THV|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0371|HKK|Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you
arctic_a0148|EBVS|Now these things had been struck dead within him
arctic_b0177|ASI|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0107|ERMS|If you only could know how I thank you
arctic_a0345|ABA|She was trying to pass the apron string around him
arctic_a0274|YBAA|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house
arctic_a0400|NCC|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0400|SVBI|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0511|TNI|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal
arctic_b0177|PNV|Her gray eyes were flashing and her lips were quivering
arctic_a0177|YBAA|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled
arctic_b0438|NCC|They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank
arctic_b0386|ERMS|My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives
arctic_b0226|BWC|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0209|HKK|He's terribly touchy about his black wards as he calls them
arctic_a0473|SVBI|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0030|TNI|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips
arctic_b0226|PNV|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_a0450|SKA|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
arctic_b0226|NCC|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0050|PNV|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin
arctic_a0049|ABA|Gregson was asleep when he reentered the cabin
arctic_b0116|BWC|I have hunted along this ridge replied Philip
arctic_b0011|THV|His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face
arctic_b0464|YDCK|I could not agree with Ernest
arctic_b0171|LXC|He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair
arctic_a0473|TLV|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0473|TXHC|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_a0400|SKA|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_b0419|HKK|Your father's fifth command he nodded
arctic_b0347|NCC|But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano
arctic_a0284|RRBI|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes
arctic_a0400|HQTV|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0400|ABA|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0473|NCC|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0333|PNV|It does was her audacious answer
arctic_b0053|SKA|That is why I am am rattled he laughed
arctic_b0262|NJS|Saxon's onto her job
arctic_a0112|LXC|He was wounded in the arm
arctic_a0244|TXHC|He was the soul of devotion to his employers
arctic_a0466|HJK|Captain West may be a Samurai but he is also human
arctic_b0315|BWC|And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal
arctic_b0420|THV|On occasion on this traverse the Cape Verde Islands are raised
arctic_b0467|TNI|Let us run them for ourselves
arctic_b0220|SKA|Harry Bancroft Dave lied
arctic_a0169|TXHC|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant
arctic_a0060|TNI|Anyway no one saw her like that
arctic_a0203|SVBI|They were following the shore of a lake
arctic_a0348|BWC|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty
arctic_b0352|NJS|Now just what do you want to know
arctic_a0199|ERMS|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
arctic_b0268|HKK|Saxon nodded and the boy frowned
arctic_a0470|SKA|He spat it out like so much venom
arctic_a0361|TLV|But he did not broach it preferring to mature it carefully
arctic_b0023|EBVS|MacDougall my engineer believes it
arctic_a0400|LXC|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0350|TLV|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing
arctic_a0204|TNI|The wolf dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him
arctic_a0557|EBVS|The last refugee had passed
arctic_a0034|HQTV|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children
arctic_b0012|HQTV|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him
arctic_a0111|LXC|Instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
arctic_b0478|ASI|The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition
arctic_b0208|YKWK|You read the quotations in today's paper
arctic_a0075|TNI|There has been a change she interrupted him
arctic_a0473|MBMPS|The night was calm and snowy
arctic_b0226|HKK|Your face was the personification of duplicity
arctic_b0145|YBAA|Besides had he not whipped the big owl in the forest
arctic_a0400|HKK|Manuel had one besetting sin
arctic_a0576|LXC|And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers
arctic_b0384|YKWK|The skipper's and Na ka tas gymnastics served as a translation without words
